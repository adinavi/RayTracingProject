# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

This project is based on Peter Shirley's *Ray Tracing in One Weekend*. It demonstrates basic ray tracing concepts, such as generating rays, handling colors, and rendering simple objects in 3D space.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains source files for the ray tracer.
  - `main.cpp`: Entry point for rendering an image.
  - `vec3.h`: Defines the Vec3 class for 3D vectors, colors, and points.
  - `ray.h`: Defines the Ray class, which represents a ray in 3D space.

## How to Run
Compile the project using a C++ compiler and run `main.cpp` to generate a basic image.
